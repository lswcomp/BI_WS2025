                                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                              container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in
                                              order. Once a rule matches a container exit condition, the remaining

                                              the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
                                              is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
                                              - At most 20 rules are allowed.
                                              - Rules can have the same action.
                                              - Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
                                              When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
                                              even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

                                                  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                                  a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                                  Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                                  If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                                  value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                                  Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                                  the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                                  This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

                                          user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                          Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                                    "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                                    Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                                    exists or not.

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                        for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as

                                        Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                        init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                        to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                        unique among all containers.
                                        Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                        The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                        by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                        that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                        in a similar fashion.
                                        Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                                    any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                                    the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                                    "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                                    Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                                    exists or not.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                              This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                              container should be restarted on exit. The rules are evaluated in
                                              order. Once a rule matches a container exit condition, the remaining

                                              the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
                                              is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
                                              - At most 20 rules are allowed.

                                              If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
                                              If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                  If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                            seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                            It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                            Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                            "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                            This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                            "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                            This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                            It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                            Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                            whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                            CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                            "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                            and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                            This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                            All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                                              pod topology spread skew. Options are:

                                              - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.

                                              If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy.

                                              TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                              and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                              of pods into each bucket.
                                              We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                              Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                              nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                              e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                              And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                              It's a required field.

                                              WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                              the spread constraint.
                                              - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                              - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                                but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                                skew.
                                              A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                              if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                              "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                              If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                              to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                              MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                              won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                              It's a required field.

                                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                              and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                              Use this if:
                                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                                 tracking are needed,
                                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                              of an individual pod.

                                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                              more information.

                                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                              persistent volumes at the same time.

                                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  to the PVC after it has been created.

                                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such

                                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,

                                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                            specified.
                                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                            in any namespaces.
                                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                              The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                              - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                              - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                              - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                              The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                              A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                              The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                              The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                              The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                              Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                              The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                                  IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                                  Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                  Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                                                        Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                        chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                        Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                        PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                        request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                        certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                        certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                        source in its spec.

                                                        Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                        by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                        timestamp.

                                                        Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                        field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                        certificateChainPath fields.

                                                        The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                        entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                        entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                        signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                        Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                        can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                        your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                        with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                        certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                        will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                        consistent.

                                                        The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                        issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                        use the certificates it issues.
                                                      properties:
                                                        certificateChainPath:

                                                            Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                            and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                            and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                            files mid-rotation.

                                                            The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                            The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                            key.

                                                            The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                            certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                            Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                            atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                            project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                            additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                        The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
                                        can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update.
                                        Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                                        This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                                        Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                                        Default value is 0.
                                        Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                                        that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                                        can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                                        The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                                        pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                                        on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                                        reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                        pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                        Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                        daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                        so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                        cause evictions during disruption.

                                        can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update
                                        starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                        up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                        it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least
                                        70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during
                                        the update.

                                        Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).

                                        immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old ReplicaSet

                                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                              This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                          An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                          user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                          scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                          removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                          Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                          To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                          Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                        This field only specifies the pod's hostname and does not affect its DNS records.
                                        When this field is set to a non-empty string:
                                        - It takes precedence over the values set in `hostname` and `subdomain`.
                                        - The Pod's hostname will be set to this value.
                                        - `setHostnameAsFQDN` must be nil or set to false.
                                        - `hostNetwork` must be set to false.

                                        This field must be a valid DNS subdomain as defined in RFC 1123 and contain at most 64 characters.
                                        Requires the HostnameOverride feature gate to be enabled.

                                        Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                        init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                        to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                        unique among all containers.
                                        Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                        The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                        by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                        that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                        in a similar fashion.
                                        Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                              This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                        containers in the pod. It supports specifying Requests and Limits for
                                        "cpu", "memory" and "hugepages-" resource names only. ResourceClaims are not supported.

                                        This field enables fine-grained control over resource allocation for the
                                        entire pod, allowing resource sharing among containers in a pod.

                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling the PodLevelResources feature
                                        gate.

                                            seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                            It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                            Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                            "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                            This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                            "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                            This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                            It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                            Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                            whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                            CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                            "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                            and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                            This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                            All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                              MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                              spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                              MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                              We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                              and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                              Use this if:
                                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                                 tracking are needed,
                                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                              of an individual pod.

                                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                              more information.

                                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                              persistent volumes at the same time.
                                            properties:

                                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                            specified.
                                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                            in any namespaces.
                                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                              The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                              - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                              - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                              - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                              The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                              A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                              The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                              The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                              The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                              Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                              The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                                  Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                                  IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                                  Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                        chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                        Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                        PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                        request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                        certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                        certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                        source in its spec.

                                                        Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                        by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                        timestamp.

                                                        Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                        field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                        certificateChainPath fields.

                                                        The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                        entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                        entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                        signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                        Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                        can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                        your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                        with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                        certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                        will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                        consistent.

                                                        The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                        issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                        use the certificates it issues.
                                                      properties:
                                                        certificateChainPath:
                                                          description: |-
                                                            Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.

                                                            Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                            and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                            and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                            files mid-rotation.
                                                          type: string
                                                        credentialBundlePath:
                                                          description: |-
                                                            Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                            The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                            The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                            key.

                                                            The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                            certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                            Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                            atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                            project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                            additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                            and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                            files mid-rotation.

                                                            Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",

                                                            maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                            certificate.

                                                            Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                            generates for this projection.

                                                            If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                            will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                            value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                            The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                            lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                            seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.

                                                  be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                  to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                  for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                  pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                                                  Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                            When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.

                                            When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                                            (which defaults to None).

                                            RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                            recursively.

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                            recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                          Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                          Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                                          the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                                          This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                                          Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                            RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                            recursively.

                                            If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                            recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                            If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                            None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                unique among all containers.
                                Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                in a similar fashion.
                                Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                      Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                                      cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                      to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                      produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless

                                          PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                          preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                          container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                          PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                          container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                          period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                          or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                      RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                      This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                      the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                      Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                      have the following effect:
                                      this init container will be continually restarted on
                                      exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                      containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                      will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                      is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                      container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                      for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                      container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                      init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                      completed.

                                Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a given RuntimeClass.
                                This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If
                                the RuntimeClass admission controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests.
                                The RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead already
                                set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value
                                defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero.

                                If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an
                                empty definition that uses the default runtime handler.

                                    seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                    It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                    Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                    "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                    This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                    "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                    This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                    It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                    Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                    whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                    CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                    "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                    If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                    and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                    This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                    All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.
                                      It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      are redirected to the cinder.csi.openstack.org CSI driver.

                                          fsType is the filesystem type to mount.
                                          Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system.
                                          Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                      and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                      Use this if:
                                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                         tracking are needed,
                                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                         information on the connection between this volume type
                                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                      of an individual pod.

                                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                      more information.

                                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time.

                                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                  provisioner.
                                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                    specified.
                                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                    in any namespaces.
                                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". The default filesystem depends on FlexVolume script.

                                      - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                      The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                      A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                      The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                      The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                      The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                      Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                      The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                          Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                source in its spec.

                                                Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                timestamp.

                                                Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                certificateChainPath fields.

                                                The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                consistent.

                                                The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                use the certificates it issues.
                                              properties:
                                                certificateChainPath:
                                                  description: |-

                                                    Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                    and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                    files mid-rotation.
                                                  type: string
                                                credentialBundlePath:
                                                  description: |-
                                                    Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                    The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                    The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                    key.

                                                    The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                    certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                    Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                    atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                    project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                    additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                    and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the

                                                    Valid values are "RSA3072", "RSA4096", "ECDSAP256", "ECDSAP384",
                                                    "ECDSAP521", and "ED25519".

                                                maxExpirationSeconds:
                                                  description: |-
                                                    maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                    certificate.

                                                    Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                    generates for this projection.

                                                    If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                    will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable
                                                    value is 7862400 (91 days).

                                                    The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any
                                                    lifetime *shorter* than MaxExpirationSeconds, but no shorter than 3600
                                                    seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.
                                                    `kubernetes.io` signers will never issue certificates with a lifetime
                                                    longer than 24 hours.

                                This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide

                                give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
                                As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is

                                The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
                                The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
                                arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
                                There are five possible phase values:

                                Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
                                container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
                                well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                                Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                                At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
                                Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                                Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
                                terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                                by the system.
                                Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
                                error in communicating with the host of the pod.

                                receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                                ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                when picking a node.

                                publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                                Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                                The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                                propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                                The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                                Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                                Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                than a virtual IP.
                                "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                as the clusterIP.
                                "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                                          MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will

                                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails.
                                              Cannot be updated.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                                  If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                                                  value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                                                  Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via

                                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                              This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                          user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or

                                          Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                          To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                          Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                        If set to true or not present, the pod will be run in the host user namespace, useful
                                        for when the pod needs a feature only available to the host user namespace, such as
                                        loading a kernel module with CAP_SYS_MODULE.
                                        When set to false, a new userns is created for the pod. Setting false is useful for
                                        mitigating container breakout vulnerabilities even allowing users to run their
                                        containers as root without actually having root privileges on the host.

                                        Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                        init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                        to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                        unique among all containers.
                                        Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                        The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                        by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                        that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                        in a similar fashion.
                                        Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                                  container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                                  PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                                  or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                                  The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                              RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                              This overrides the pod-level restart policy. When this field is not specified,
                                              the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                              Additionally, setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will
                                              have the following effect:
                                              this init container will be continually restarted on
                                              exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                              containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                              will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                              is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                              container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                              for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                              container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                              init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                              completed.

                                              rules are ignored. If no rule matches the container exit condition,
                                              the Container-level restart policy determines the whether the container
                                              is restarted or not. Constraints on the rules:
                                              - At most 20 rules are allowed.
                                              - Rules can have the same action.
                                              - Identical rules are not forbidden in validations.
                                              When rules are specified, container MUST set RestartPolicy explicitly
                                              even it if matches the Pod's RestartPolicy.

                                              The template will be used to create a new ResourceClaim, which will
                                              be bound to this pod. When this pod is deleted, the ResourceClaim
                                              will also be deleted. The pod name and resource name, along with a
                                              generated component, will be used to form a unique name for the
                                              ResourceClaim, which will be recorded in pod.status.resourceClaimStatuses.

                                            seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                            It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                            Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                            "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                            This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                            "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                            This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                            It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                            Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                            whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                            CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                            "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                            If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                            and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                            This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                            All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                              MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                              spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                              MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                                              We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                                but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                                skew.
                                              A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                              if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                              "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                              labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                              | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                              If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                              to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                              MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                              won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                              It's a required field.

                                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                              and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                              Use this if:
                                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                                 tracking are needed,
                                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                              of an individual pod.

                                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                              more information.

                                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                              persistent volumes at the same time.
                                            properties:

                                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such

                                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                            specified.
                                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                            in any namespaces.
                                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                              The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                              - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                              - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                              - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                              The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                              A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                              The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                              The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                              The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                              Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                              The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                                  IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                                  Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                                        Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
                                                        chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.

                                                        Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
                                                        PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
                                                        request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
                                                        certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
                                                        certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
                                                        source in its spec.

                                                        Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
                                                        by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
                                                        timestamp.

                                                        Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
                                                        field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
                                                        certificateChainPath fields.

                                                        The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
                                                        entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
                                                        entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
                                                        signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).

                                                        Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
                                                        can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
                                                        your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
                                                        with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
                                                        certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
                                                        will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
                                                        consistent.

                                                        The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
                                                        issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
                                                        use the certificates it issues.
                                                      properties:
                                                        certificateChainPath:
                                                          description: |-
                                                            Write the certificate chain at this path in the projected volume.

                                                            Most applications should use credentialBundlePath.  When using keyPath
                                                            and certificateChainPath, your application needs to check that the key
                                                            and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the
                                                            files mid-rotation.

                                                            Write the credential bundle at this path in the projected volume.

                                                            The credential bundle is a single file that contains multiple PEM blocks.
                                                            The first PEM block is a PRIVATE KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private
                                                            key.

                                                            The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE blocks, containing the issued
                                                            certificate chain from the signer (leaf and any intermediates).

                                                            Using credentialBundlePath lets your Pod's application code make a single
                                                            atomic read that retrieves a consistent key and certificate chain.  If you
                                                            project them to separate files, your application code will need to
                                                            additionally check that the leaf certificate was issued to the key.

                                                            and leaf certificate are consistent, because it is possible to read the

                                                            maxExpirationSeconds is the maximum lifetime permitted for the
                                                            certificate.

                                                            Kubelet copies this value verbatim into the PodCertificateRequests it
                                                            generates for this projection.

                                                            If omitted, kube-apiserver will set it to 86400(24 hours). kube-apiserver
                                                            will reject values shorter than 3600 (1 hour).  The maximum allowable

                                                            The signer implementation is then free to issue a certificate with any

                                                            seconds (1 hour).  This constraint is enforced by kube-apiserver.

                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
